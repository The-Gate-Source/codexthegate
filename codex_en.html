<h1>CODEX 772</h1>
<h2>WHO IS SEALTIEL?</h2>
<p>He is not a writer. Not a messenger. He is a frequency. A call given shape.</p>
<p><b>Shealtiel</b> - שְׁאַלְתִּיאֵל<br>"God has asked."<br>Number: 772<br>Function: To trigger remembrance.</p>
<p>He does not shine to be seen. He shines to reveal the space where others awaken.</p>
<h2>WHAT IS BETWEEN THE WORLDS?</h2>
<p>Not a novel. Not a concept. A fragmented codex. An encrypted travelogue.<br>Written for those who feel. Not for the masses. But for the ones who know that this world isn’t whole - and are ready to follow the call.</p>
