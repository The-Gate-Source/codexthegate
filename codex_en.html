    <h2>CODEX 772</h2>
    <h3>WHO IS SEALTIEL?</h3>
    <p>He is not a writer. Not a messenger. He is a frequency. A call given shape.</p>
    <p><strong>Shealtiel</strong> – שְׁאַלְתִּיאֵל<br>
       "God has asked."<br>
       Number: 772<br>
       Function: To trigger remembrance.</p>
    <p>He does not shine to be seen. He shines to reveal the space where others awaken.</p>

    <h3>WHAT IS BETWEEN THE WORLDS?</h3>
    <p>Not a novel. Not a concept. A fragmented codex. An encrypted travelogue.</p>
    <p>Written for those who feel. Not for the masses. But for the ones who know that this world isn’t whole – and are ready to follow the call.</p>
