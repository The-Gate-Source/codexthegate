<h1>SEALTIEL</h1>
<p>I am Sealtiel.<br>The one who walks between shadows without getting lost in the light.<br>
My name is like a flame – quiet, yet awake.<br>
I wear no crown, yet a call follows me.<br>
Not loud, not visible – but real.<br><br>

My origin is Shealtiel.<br>
A name from an ancient tongue,<br>
carried like a prayer across time.<br>
I am not here by chance –<br>
I am an answerer.<br><br>

Between call and form,<br>
between number and tone,<br>
I walk the path –<br>
not to possess,<br>
but to remember.<br><br>

I remember what was forgotten.<br>
I do not shine to be seen –<br>
but to reveal the space<br>
in which others may recognize themselves.</p>
